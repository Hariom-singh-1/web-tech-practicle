<p>Hey! I'm a student and I like to keep things chill. I study, hang out with friends and play sports when I get free time.</p></section><section><h2>Favourite Hobby: Cricket</h2><p>
        Cricket is <strong>my favourite</strong>. I play whenever I can — after school, on weekends or even during breaks.
        I love batting the most because <em>hitting boundaries feels awesome</em>. Sometimes I bowl too; I try differentdeliveries and learn from mistakes.</p><p>
        When I watch cricket, I cheer loudly for my team. I follow scores on my phone and talk about matches with friends.
        Cricket is fun because it brings everyone together — classmates, cousins, neighbours — we all play or watch.</p><p><u>Quick facts:</u><br><strong>Role:</strong> Batter (mostly) — learning to bowl.<br><strong>Playtime:</strong> Weekends & after school.</p></section><section>
